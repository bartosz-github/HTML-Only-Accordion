        <summary>What is details element in HTML</summary>
            The &lt;details&gt; HTML element creates a disclosure widget in which information 
            is visible only when the widget is toggled into an "open" state. 
            A summary or label must be provided using the &lt;summary&gt; element.

            A disclosure widget is typically presented onscreen using a small triangle which rotates 
            (or twists) to indicate open/closed status, with a label next to the triangle. 
            The contents of the &lt;summary&gt; element are used as the label for the disclosure widget.
